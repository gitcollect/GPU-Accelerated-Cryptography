# GPU-Accelerated Cryptography

<b>Crytographic part</b> in the final project of GPU Computing,<br /><i>Parallel Implementations of Compression and Cryptographic Algorithms</i>.

This part includes CPU- and GPU-based implementations of DES, AES and RSA.

Normally, GPU-based implementations can be 10x ~ 50x faster than CPU-based ones.

Directories:
- Cryptography: Independent command-line tool
- SharedCryptography: Shared object for JNI calls
- CudaCompCrypto: Java GUI application calling CUDA code by JNI
