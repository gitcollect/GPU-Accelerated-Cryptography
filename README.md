# GPU-Accelerated Cryptography

Crytographic part in the final project of GPU Computing

Including CPU- and GPU-based implementations of DES, AES and RSA

Normally, GPU-based implementations can be 10x ~ 50x faster than CPU-based ones.

Directories:

- Cryptography: Independent command-line tool
- SharedCryptography: Shared object for JNI calls
- CudaCompCrypto: Java GUI application calling CUDA code by JNI
